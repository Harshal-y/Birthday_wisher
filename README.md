Note :- 

	This repository is mainly for windows users. not tested this repository for linux and mac.
	
	U shall require python interpreter from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-387/ to run birthday.py but installing the latest version will also work though I used python version 3.8.7 to make this repository.

	Remeber that this code can only send a whatsapp message through your pc and that through web.whatsapp.com so you need to have web.whatsapp.com on your number.

	Pls download this repository and its files by zip method only if you don't have git or don't know how to use git.

	Date Time Format Should be like the following example : year-month-date hour:min:sec AM/PM

	Remember to edit Birthday.xlsx file and add your friends name, their date of birth, birthday message, phone number and other necessary information.

	Pls let me know if you can help me improve this project thanks in advance.

Hope you enjoy this
