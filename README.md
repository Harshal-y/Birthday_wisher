Note :- 

	This repository is mainly for windows users.
	
	U shall require python interpreter from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-387/ but you can also install latest version but 3.8.7 will also work to run birthday.py file as it is written in python programming language.

	Remeber that this code can only send a whatsapp message through your pc and that through web.whatsapp.com so you need to have web.whatsapp.com on your number.

	Pls download this repository and its files by zip method only if you don't have git or don't know how to use git.

	Date Time Format Should be like the following example : year-month-date hour:min:sec AM/PM

	Remember to edit Birthday.xlsx file and add your friends name, their date of birth, birthday message, phone number and other necessary information.
